## ✨ Overview

Welcome to my interactive portfolio! I'm Divyasri Lakshmi Alekhya Nakka, a passionate Software Engineer with expertise in full-stack development. This immersive portfolio showcases my professional journey, technical skills, and innovative projects through cutting-edge web technologies and stunning 3D graphics.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** who discovered programming through robotics, where I first combined mechanical systems with intelligent code. This experience sparked my transition into full-time software development, giving me a unique perspective on problem-solving, system design, and bridging the gap between hardware and software.

## 💼 **Professional Journey**

From mechanical engineering to backend systems and data-driven platforms, my career has been a continuous evolution of solving problems through technology. With every role, I've expanded my skills across software engineering, automation, and intelligent systems—each phase building on the last.


### 🏛️ **Bank of New York Mellon**  
*Lead Full Stack Developer | Chennai, India | Sep 2022 – Jan 2025*

At BNY Mellon, I led the development of internal automation portals and infrastructure provisioning platforms. I engineered scalable systems using React, Flask, Spring Boot, and Terraform—powering thousands of monthly interactions. I also built a real-time infrastructure metrics warehouse for proactive monitoring across hybrid environments, improving incident response and compliance. Containerizing legacy services on a custom AppEngine platform brought massive gains in uptime and deployment reliability.

### 📚 **Elsevier**  
*Senior Software Engineer | Chennai, India | Jul 2020 – Sep 2022*

At Elsevier, I worked on large-scale search intelligence systems, designing ingestion pipelines that handled over 10 million documents daily. I built a semantic search API using Elasticsearch and NLP techniques, and developed a reviewer recommendation engine that improved editorial workflows. My role spanned backend engineering, data modeling, and DevOps—deploying to Kubernetes via Terraform and Jenkins pipelines.

### 🔗 **Accenture**  
*Senior Software Engineer | Chennai, India | Aug 2019 – Jul 2020*

At Accenture, I built microservices and frontend interfaces for network operations using Spring Boot and React. I migrated critical services from Java to Python for faster iteration, and implemented Cassandra-based solutions for low-latency data access. This role sharpened my full-stack development and system integration skills.

### 🏢 **Cognizant**  
*Associate | Chennai, India | Mar 2018 – Aug 2019*

Working on Guidewire InsuranceNow, I developed solutions for policy administration, quoting, and claims. I contributed to both frontend interfaces (Angular, jQuery) and backend logic using custom servlet frameworks.

### 🖥️ **Tata Consultancy Services**  
*System Engineer | Chennai, India | May 2015 – Mar 2018*

I started my career at TCS building REST APIs, batch processing jobs with Spring Batch and Quartz, and improving performance with distributed caching. I helped modernize legacy systems by transitioning from SOAP to REST, and designed systems powered by Oracle and Elasticsearch.

Each role has deepened my understanding of scalable architecture, automation, and intelligent system design. From system-level performance to data pipelines and cloud-native tooling, I’ve remained committed to building high-impact solutions with engineering discipline and a mindset for continuous learning.
